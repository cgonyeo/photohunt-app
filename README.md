photohunt-app
=============

The android app that works with https://github.com/dgonyeo/photohunt-server

Fetches the times photohunt runs for, displays a countdown, and provides a 
button for uploading pictures.

This app does NOT take or store images, that is done by google's camera app.
There is a button to open the camera app for convenience, but this simply
uploads images that the user has taken.
